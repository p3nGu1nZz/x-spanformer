5.2 Span Routing Behavior
We   analyze the internal span distribution dynamics   induced  by the  X-Spanformer's   entropy- regularized selection module. The goal is to assess whether the model exhibits structure-seeking behavior through interpretable routing patterns under curriculum-controlled exploration:
Let P = {Pij} denote the normalized span distribution from Equation (16) , and let the controller be computed as: K exp( Wk _ S @kSk, where @k (34) K k=1 e=1 exp(we)
To understand convergence properties and architectural expressivity; we track the following quanti- tative signals:
Span Entropy Dynamics: The Shannon entropy of Pt is computed at each training epoch t: H(Pt) = - Pij log Pf) (35) (i,j)
We hypothesize that the expectation E[H (Pt)] follows exponential decay due to the schedule
Aent ! (t) = Ao * exp( _nt),
as derived in Section 4.2, mirroring curriculum learning effects observed in [54, 24]. Span Width Histogram: Let w = j-i. For each epoch; we compute the empirical distribution of selected span widths among top-K spans: A shift toward medium-length (5-12 token) units may indicate phrase- or clause-level abstraction consistent with constituent boundaries [63].
Span Overlap Rate: We define token-level overlap for each instance by computing the pairwise intersection among selected spans:
Sk 0 se| Overlap(x) = K2 |sk U se| kze
High values in early epochs reflect exploratory collapse, while convergence to disjoint or mini- mally overlapping spans signals stabilization of routing priors. Routing Stability Across Epochs: To quantify change in span selection Over time; we mea- sure the symmetric KL divergence between distributions at adjacent epochs:
KLsym ! (Pt || Pt+1) = KL(Pt || Pt+1) + KL(Pt+1 |l Pt).
Declining divergence indicates the system has stabilized its structural hypothesis.
