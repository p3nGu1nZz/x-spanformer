X-SPANFORMER
SPAN-AwARE ENCODER
Remark: Proposition 6 establishes the upper bound of entropy over span routing distributions. Early training with high Aent promotes structural exploration, while annealing enables convergence to sparse, high-salience spans. This   tradeoff between   uncertainty maximization and structural commitment parallels entropy-annealed models of parse induction [55] and marginal span recovery [56].

Controller-Aware Generation and Final Objective
The fused span summary vector 3 â‚¬ Rd serves as a global control signal for conditioning the trans former encoder. Rather than statically appending $, X-Spanformer supports multiple integration pathways that modify computation at different stages of the network: To compute the controller, we define:
K
exp( Wk_ K e=1 exp(we)
S =
@kSk, k=1
where @k
where each sk Pool(cik:jk . is a pooled span representation, and Wk = 96 (8k, Ok, confk) is a learned span-specific Salience score incorporating structural and uncertainty features.
