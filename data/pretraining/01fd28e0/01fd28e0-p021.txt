transformer parameters:
Model optimization proceeds via the composite loss:
=
Ltotal Ltask + B1Lspan + 82Cent,
(31)
where:
Ltask: task-aligned objective (e-g , cross-entropy, contrastive alignment); Lspan = KL( Pgold P): span KL alignment; Lent = ~Aent H(P): entropy regularization term
To isolate structural behavior, we evaluate:
Span distribution entropy H(P) =-Z(i;j) Pij log Pij; Controller gate variance Var(o(Wgs)); Span overlap rate: fraction of selected spans sharing token positions; Downstream impact: change in token-level logit outputs under controller ablation.
Experimental Philosophy. Our experiments are structured not as competitive benchmarks, but as architectural diagnostics to validate the inductive mechanism of span-aware routing: This aligns with prior work in structural probing and latent routing models [28, 51, 56].
Note: All results in this section are presented for illustrative and developmental purposes. Empir- ical benchmarks for generalization, transferability; and performance scaling are left to future work as model weights stabilize and structure supervision matures.

Experimental Setup
We design our experimental pipeline to test the structural expressivity and routing fidelity of X- Spanformer in isolation from large-scale benchmark supervision   Following best practices in latent structure induction [55, 63, 67], we  employ a diagnostic protocol based on entropy decay; span structure visualization, and controller variance tracking:
Datasets. We conduct experiments on the following sources:
Synthetic Span Induction Corpus: A handcrafted suite of synthetic sentence templates constructed using the Stream-Mix generator [68], which provides hierarchical stream-label anno- tations and configurable entropy constraints: This dataset allows controlled testing of routing alignment under known compositional structure WikiText-103 [69]: Unsupervised language modeling corpus used to evaluate span stability and routing coherence over noisy naturalistic prose.
