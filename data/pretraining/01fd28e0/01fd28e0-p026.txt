wlt) _ H(Pt) is Lipschitz-continu0us,
(ii) Gradient steps use 0 bounded step size n > 0,
(iii) The task gradient is negligible: w(t) Ltask ~ 0 during spam routing:
Then entropy decays exponentially: H(Pt) < H(Po) . evt= Vt 2 0.
Proof: We compute the partial derivative of the entropy with respect to each logit:
exp(Wp C 0 exp(w e
U
H(Pt) = ak (logaf) + 1) where
The gradient descent update becomes: (t+1) Wk W6
~yt (t) nAoe @6 '(log ak + 1).
Since H(P) is convex in logits and smooth under softmax, we apply the descent lemma:
H(Pt+1) < H(Pt) = nAoe-xt . HVH(P)ll?.
Assume |IVH(Pt)ll2 > cH(Pt) for some constant c > 0, yielding:
H(Pt+1) < H(Pt) . (1 = ncdoe -vt).
Iteratively unrolling:
t_1
H(Pt) < H(Po) . IIa ~ ncAoe-~87 s=0
Using 1 _ 2 < e%
t-1 H(Pt) < H(Po)  exp ~ncAo e"Y8 s=0 Evaluating the geometric sum:
t-1 =e Yt e"Ys = 1 _ e-Y
1 _ e-Y
Hence; with C = 14,
H(Pt) < H(Po) - e-C(-e-w) . Since e-Yt 0, the bound becomes
H(Pt) < H(Po) . eYt , for some ~ < %,
as claimed.
