Mode Disambiguation
To quantify controller disambiguation acrOSs routing paths, we measure variance between induced representations under  different interpolation vectors 3(1) + :(2) derived from two distinct span combinations S(1) , S(2)_ Let (m,i) hfinal be the layer L hidden state under controller vector s(i) with mode m, then: Dfoute Er~D hfinal 'mal) (x) 1Ga? ()l,] higher Droute implies that controller fusion more effectively channels distinct routing hypotheses (m) into separable downstream representations:
Gated Probe Interventions. Following the probing methodology in [71], we optionally perform controller swap experiments: Scontent Sconfound , while keeping x fixed. This tests whether the model's behavior aligns more with structural routing O surface-level tokens, revealing how $ perturbs token importance. Proposition 10 (Disentanglement under Orthogonal Controllers) . Let 3(1)_ 8(2) € Rd be orthogonal controller vectors such that (3(1),3(2)) = 0, and let the layer € hidden state be modulated by additive controller fusion: he = f(w') + Ws, where Wn 6 Rd' xd 18 the injection weight matrix for fusion mode m, and f(:) 18 the controller- independent component. Assume the final output logits are computed via a linear decoder: Fm(w,5) = VhL , where V € RCxd' projects to logits over C classes: If Wn i8 full rank and vWe m has spectral norm bounded below by Ve > 0, then: |Fn(w,5()) - Fm (r,sellzze:Iso) _ 3(2)|l: 2
Proof: We compute the difference in output logits: 2 Fn(1,3()) _ Fn(r,3(2)) = VWn " (3(1) 5 3(2)) .
By the definition of the operator norm: IAIl? = lvwno (3(1) ~ s)l:; Since vWC m is a linear map from Rd 7 RC , and :(1) _ s(2) lies in Rd we apply the norm inequality for linear transformations: IaI} 2 ogin ` Ilsa) s2l2 where   omin is the smallest singular value of VWA_ By assumption; VWQ m is full-rank and has minimal singular value at least Ve, so Hali 2 e . 3(1) _ 3(2)|l: 2
This completes the proof.
