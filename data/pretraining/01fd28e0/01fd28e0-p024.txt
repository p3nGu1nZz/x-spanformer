These routing diagnostics provide evidence that X-Spanformer gradually shifts from high-entropy; overlapping routing to sparse; high-confidence span representations. This aligns with latent atten- tion sparsification in architectures such as MoE Transformers [43], Routing Transformers [51], and mixture-of-expert decoders [28]. Crucially, our formulation achieves this behavior without discrete gating O reinforcement-based span extraction, relying entirely on differentiable gradient flow from the full objective: Lfinal = Ltask + Aent (t) . H(Pt) + 81 Lalign , where Aent ' (t) = Aoe-xt controls the entropy decay schedule and Lalign optionally enforces span-level alignment during supervised routing:
Proposition 8 (Routing Convergence Bound). Let Hmax = log ISL be the maximum entropy over the   umiform   span distribution on the   candidate set S, and let H(Pt) denote   the   entropy  of the learned span distribution at epoch t_ Under a fired entropy annealing schedule Aent (t) = Aoe-7t with Ao,~ > 0, and assuming entropy-dominated gradient flow during early routing, the following upper bound holds: H(Pt) < Hmax ` e"Yt
