6.3 Controller Influence Map (influence_heatmap)
This module evaluates the downstream sensitivity of network outputs to variation in the controller signal s_ We use this to assess disentanglement and directional salience of span-based routing:
Method
1. Inject perturbed vectors Sbaseline, Sperturbed into layer 2. Measure output response via:
Oout = IF(w,51) - F(w,s2)ll2
(43)
3. Visualize effect across token positions and logit spaces
This is inspired by mediation analyses in causal probing [71, 86] and offers interpretability ofrouting pathways without direct supervision.
6.4 Entropy Field Morphometry (entropy_map)
To inspect global routing structure, we   visualize span entropy across token windows and layers. This "morphometric map' reveals compositional boundaries, entropy basins; and emergence of high- confidence foci.
Method
1. For every candidate span (i,j) at each layer , compute:
(e) @k log &k
0 where Q1 selects spans overlapping (i,j)
H{ = -_
(44)
2 Aggregate per-position entropy into a 2D token-layer grid
3. Render high-confidence routes as brightness troughs
This is modeled after flow-field visualizations in neural saliency [87], adapted here for differentiable sparse span selectors [53, 77].
Ablation Studies
To assess the contribution of individual architectural components in the X-Spanformer, we conduct controlled ablation studies by selectively removing O altering key modules. Each experiment is evaluated on the SeqMatch benchmark [88] with mean span-F1 as the primary metric:
