Routing Execution Loop
To contextualize the effect of these parameters, we present the routing and loss construction pipeline:

Gradient Interactions and Entropy Control
The combined influence of entropy and alignment on controller gradients is given by:
Lfinal = Aoe-~t W
Wk H(Pt) + 81
Wk Lalign *

Early in training; the entropy term dominates, encouraging exploratory and smooth distributions over candidate spans [53]. As y increases, sharper annealing quickly reduces entropy; leading to peaked confidence and accelerated convergence. Meanwhile, 81 scales the alignment supervision, anchoring span selection in structural prior regions: This occurs in low-entropy regimes to prevent collapse onto degenerate spans [77].
Proposition: Stability of Entropy-Gated Routing
Proposition 11 (Span Entropy Convergence Under Annealing). Let Pt be the span distribution at epoch t, and H(Pt) its entropy: Suppose controller updates are primarily influenced by the entropy term in the loss, with annealing  schedule Aent ' (t) = Aoert_ Then the entropy satisfies the decay bound: H(Pt) Hmax e"Yt where Hmax 3 log ISl: (40)
