Tokenization remains a limiting factor in contemporary transformer architectures, typically grounded in static subword vocabularies that generalize poorly across heterogeneous or evolving textual inputs."
3,"We introduce X-Spanformer, a tokenizer-free segmentation module that re places heuristic lexical boundaries with dynamic span prediction inspired by X-bar theory: The model initializes with a compact lk-unit BPE vocabulary [1, 2] and transitions to span-based segmentation via a pointer network [3], supervised through an annealed auxiliary loss schedule Predicted spans are variable-length, overlapping, softly typed by modality (e-8-, code, natural language, identifier) , and dynamically capped per input using a learned span length estimator: Span representations are composed and injected into downstream encoders, allowing seamless integration with pretrained or co-trained transformer stacks We hypothesize that learned span prediction provides more semantically aligned and compression-efficient tokenization than fixed BPE or byte-level alternatives."
4,"To investigate this; we construct a multi-phase curriculum that bootstraps from synthetic segmentation labels and gradually introduces stream-type-aligned supervision: We detail evaluation protocols for measuring compression ratio contrastive re- trieval alignment, span entropy; and modality coherence   Preliminary results suggest improved interpretability and structural alignment, supporting our hypothesis. We release a standalone ONNX-compatible implementation along with training recipes and COrpus construction guide lines to facilitate adoption across code, language, and hybrid domains

Introduction
Transformer architectures underpin leading solutions in natural language understanding; program synthesis; and multimodal retrieval [4, 5, 6, 7]. Central to these models is a static segmentation stage that partitions input into fixed subword units, most commonly via Byte-Pair Encoding [1] or SentencePiece [2]."
5,"While effective on in-domain corpora, these pipelines impose immutable lexical boundaries that degrade under domain shift, obscure long-range compositional patterns in code and multilingual text"

Segmentation is traditionally decoupled from model training, treated as an irreversible preprocess ing operation that lacks gradient flow and cannot adapt to downstream objectives. Recent  work in character-aware encoding [9], tokenization-free models [10], and unsupervised segmentation in sequential domains [11, 12] demonstrates the potential of adaptive boundaries: However , these ap- proaches often omit linguistic structure and do not offer interpretable segmentation aligned with phrase-level semantics. Drawing on the X-bar  schema from generative grammar [13], we posit that raw token streams (for example, source code, natural language, or symbolic hybrids) exhibit latent hierarchical units that can be learned directly from data:"
8,"We introduce X-Spanformer, a span-based segmenter that formulates boundary detection as a pointer-network prediction task [3]. Beginning with a compact one-thousand-unit BPE seed, X-Spanformer learns to emit overlapping; variable-length spans that are softly typed by modality (for example, code, natural language, or identifier) and capped per sequence via a learned length estimator. Span representations are aggregated by pooling and integrated into downstream transformer encoders, enabling joint optimization of segmentation and task-specific objectives:

Static Subword Tokenization
Most transformer pipelines rely on offline subword segmentation. Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) con- structs a fixed vocabulary by iteratively merging frequent symbol pairs extracted from a training corpus [1]. SentencePiece builds on unigram language models to select subword tokens that maxi- mize corpus likelihood [2]: Such methods yield efficient lookup tables and have become ubiquitous in large-scale language models"
10,"[4, 5], but they impose irrevocable boundaries that do not adapt during model training and can fragment semantically coherent units under domain shift [8].

Character-Level and Token-Free Models
To mitigate subword brittleness, several works propose bypassing static vocabularies in favor of character- or byte-driven   encoding: Charformer applies gradient-based subword tokenization to learn latent splits during pretraining; compressing sequences without a predefined vocabulary [9]. CANINE directly encodes Unicode codepoints with down-sampling and up-sampling layers, offering a tokenization-free encoder that matches BPE baselines on transfer tasks [10]. These approaches remove offline heuristics; but they do not explicitly model higher-order linguistic 0 symbolic struc tures. 2.3 Unsupervised and Differentiable Segmentation
Beyond character-level models; unsupervised segmentation methods aim to learn meaningful units directly from raw streams."
12,"Morfessor induces morpheme-like units via minimum description length objectives [14]. In the neural domain, probabilistically masked language models (PMLM) inte- grate segmentation into pretraining with masked span prediction [12]. Other works learn segmen- tation boundaries for text-to-text generation by optimizing a downstream reconstruction loss [11]. While these methods introduce differentiability; they lack   explicit linguistic priors and produce non-overlapping, fixed partitions:
2.4 Span-Based and Pointer-Network Models
Pointer networks offer & mechanism for predicting variable-length spans by emitting start and end indices over an input sequence [3]. SpanBERT extends this idea in pretraining by masking contigu- ous spans and predicting their content [15]."
13,"In speech and vision; learned segmenters often output overlapping proposals that improve detection and alignment [16, 17]."
14,"However , to our knowledge no prior work unifies pointer-based span prediction with linguistically grounded structure for text segmentation in transformer encoders:
2.5 Summary
Existing  segmentation   strategies  fall into three broad categories: offline   subword  tokenization; character-level or token-free encoders, and unsupervised boundary learners: Offline methods such as BPE and SentencePiece offer efficient lookups but impose static vocabularies that fragment long- range structures and fail under domain shift [1, 2, 8]. Character-level and byte-level approaches eliminate heuristic preprocessing yet lack explicit modeling of phrase-level regularities and often incur higher  computational cost [9, 10]. Unsupervised segmentation methods introduce differen- tiability but produce non-overlapping; monolithic partitions without linguistic priors [14, 1l, 12]."
15,"Span-based predictors and pointer-network architectures enable variable-length boundary propos- als but have not been combined with generative grammar principles for text segmentation [3, 15].

Architecture
This section formalizes the modular components of X-Spanformer and their interactions within the segmentation pipeline: Each architectural unit is presented with motivation, precise mathematical formulation; and pseudocode where appropriate. We conclude with strategies for integrating outputs into standard transformer encoders, including support for overlapping span interpolation, and a runtime complexity analysis: X-Spanformer is bootstrapped by a compact BPE vocabularyl and produces:

Span-level augmentation follows the strategy used in models that embed auxiliary semantic units alongside token streams [15, 5]. Unlike early segmentation-based models that hard-assign phrasal structure [13], we treat spans as latent soft units learned through boundary confidence and pooling: All modules are trained jointly with the downstream encoder. 3.1 Seed Embeddings and Candidate Set
The segmentation process begins with a sequence of base representations, or  seed embeddings, which are intended to provide a minimal yet expressive lexical signal for identifying higher-order linguistic structure These embeddings, derived from a lightweight subword tokenizer, anchor the span predictor in a sparse but stable input space.3 Formally; given an input sequence tokenized to L elements, we define the embedding matrix E = [e1, ."
18,"eL] € RLxd
where each ei is a token-level embedding, and d is the model's dimensionality: This sequence is processed through a contextualizing encoder: H = Encoder (E) € RLxd
yielding contextual representations H 3 [h1, - hL]:4 From this, the model constructs a complete candidate set of potential spans:
C = {(i,j) | 1 <i < j < L} We initialize tokenization with SentencePiece [2] or similar to avoid fixed-length subword bias while maintaining fast bootstrapping and ONNX compatibility: This follows principles also found in token-free models such as ByT5 [18] and CANINE"

3.2 Span Predictor
The span predictor computes a scalar confidence score for each candidate span (i,j) € C, reflecting how likely that subsequence is to form a coherent semantic O syntactic unit."
22,"Inspired by boundary- based approaches in segmentation-aware models [11, 15], we model start and end posit tions inde- pendently: This simplification makes inference tractable, allows for efficient parallel scoring, and empirically yields high-quality span proposals across domains 5 We compute unnormalized logits and normalized distributions over token positions: = WsH + bs, &zp"" softmax( €8 = WeH + be, &pe softmax(€e)_ where /s , Qe e RL and p; denotes the probability of a span beginning at position i, with p; denoting its end at j.

This outer-product scoring approach has been widely used for efficient span extraction in question answering and entity recognition tasks [22, 23]. It biases selection toward spans with high local boundary salience while preserving diversity through length variation: We then extract the top-K scoring candidates: S = TopK {score(i,j) | (i,j) € C} ."
23,"Proposition 1 (Top-K Marginal Likelihood). Let p8 € 4L and pe € 4L be independent boundary distributions over L token positions. Define the induced span measure P(i,j) = pi p; over the candidate set C = {(i,j) | 1 <i < j < L}."
24,"Then, under the independence assumption, the optimal set of K spans that maximizes the total marginal likelihood is given by: S = TopK {P(i,j) | (i,j) € C} ,
and satisfies:
S = arg max P(i,j). S'CC 1S'|=K (i,j)es'
Proof   By construction, each candidate span (i,j) is assigned an  unnormalized confidence score P(i,j) under the product measure derived from independent start and end distributions Since P(i,j) is nonnegative and additive, selecting the top K values of P(i,j) maximizes the total like lihood mass over  any subset of size K: This  corresponds to exact greedy maximization under the monotonic additive objective Z(ij)es Pli,j). The independence assumption ensures that no additional structural constraint or interaction term modifies this score. SThis factorized assumption follows successful precedents in span-based QA [22] and structured pretraining [15].

3.3 Length Estimator
While the span predictor yields high-confidence candidates based on boundary positions; it lacks an inductive bias toward plausible internal structure ~such as the typical width of syntactic; semantic, Or modality-specific spans: To address this; we introduce a length estimator: a learned prior over span widths that filters proposals based 0n predicted span length compatibility. 6
For each proposed span (i,j) € $, we define its length:
6 = j -i+1."
26,"We then pool features over the span window:
Vij Pool( H[i:j]) € Rd,
where Pool(:) may be mean pooling; max pooling; o self-attentive aggregation. This representation is passed through a classifier head that outputs a categorical distribution over discretized length bins: =

The predicted length $ acts as a prior over plausible widths and is compared against the actual span length 6. We retain only those spans for which the prediction deviates from the ground truth by at most a fixed tolerance: 5' = {6,j) e s |16 _ 81<w} where T 2 0 is a hyperparameter   governing   flexibility: This length-aware filtering mechanism discourages degenerate; overly short, or overly long span hypotheses, and has been shown to improve accuracy in both text segmentation and vision attention tasks"

28,"Then the number of retained spans satisfies: 1S' | = 0 (L . (2v + 1)) _
Proof: Fix a start index 2. For each predicted length &, the end index must satisfy:
j e |s+i-7_1, 6+ i+7_1|
i.e., a window of size (2r + 1)."
29,"For each of the L start positions, at most (21 + 1) spans can fall within the allowed deviation from 0, yielding the stated linear bound. This procedure constrains the spatial budget of the model, enabling sub-quadratic proposal filtering and tractable decoding over long-form sequences It also reflects cognitively grounded priors on span regularity and compositional unit length [13, 24]. 6This style of predictive regularization is aligned with latent structure filtering techniques in segmentation-aware pretraining [11, 12], and echoes classic Bayesian constraints in alignment models [24]."

Modality Typing
Spans in source sequences often originate from heterogeneous subdomains ~such as natural language, programming syntax; structured identifiers, numeric expressions, Or markup. Accurate identification of a span's modality enables the model to apply domain-specialized logic (e:g , routing to type specific heads; enforcing syntax-aware constraints, Or improving retrieval and alignment). 8"
32,"To this end, we introduce a shallow classification head that predicts a probability distribution over T predefined modalities for each span: Let ij € Rd be the pooled embedding for span (i, j) , produced by the same pooling operator used in the length estimator: Uij = Pool( H[i:j]). We compute logits and a normalized modality distribution:
type ei = WtUij + bt,
type pij softmax( etype
The vector ptype T represents the model's belief over  candidate types, capturing epistemic uncertainty in ambiguous or code-switched contexts [27]. This representation serves three purposes:
1. Auxiliary Supervision: When modality annotations are available, a croSS-entropy loss be tween ptype and gold labels provides an auxiliary training signal. This approach aligns with multitask conditioning frameworks like UnifiedQA"
33,"[29] and improves zero-shot transfer in underrepresented types [28]. 2 . Stream Conditioning: During decoding O1 croSS-_ attention, type distributions can be used to guide soft routing among specialized decoder blocks O1  prompt adapters"
34,"[30], enabling modular reasoning across modalities: 3. Interpretability and Diagnostics: The modality classifier enhances model transparency by linking segmentation decisions to functional subdomains especially in token-level mixtures or generated scaffolding tasks: 9
3.5 Span Embedding
Each retained span (i,j) € S' must be mapped to a fixed-size vector representation suitable for downstream fusion: This embedding is intended to capture both the internal structure and the contextual salience of the span, serving aS a condensed representation of its semantic Or syntactic role. Effective span  encodings have been  shown to improve performance in question answering, entity linking; and structured generation tasks [32, 15, 33]."
35,"We  explore two span encoding strategies, inspired by prior work in segment pooling and local contextualization: See [27, 28] for techniques that use token- or span-level typing to improve generative fluency and interpretability in mixed-modality environments. 9This is particularly useful for diagnosing over-segmentation, ambiguous boundaries, Or routing errors in compo- sitional data streams [31, 20]."

Importantly; standard transformer encoders can process this composite sequence without architec- tural modification, as the inserted vectors match token dimensionality and participate in multi-head attention identically [5, 7, 35]."
39,This approach mirrors the insertion of learned prompt tokens Or re- trieved vectors into encoder-decoder models without altering core attention mechanics.
40,"However,; to prevent positional ambiguity and enforce separation between token and span-originated embeddings, we optionally apply specialized feature encodings (such as segment tags, span-type biases; o learned offsets) to preserve structural grounding [30, 37, 18].

Span Interpolation for Overlap Resolution
To gracefully handle overlapping Or redundant spans, X-Spanformer employs a continuous interpola- tion mechanism over the filtered set S' = {(ik, Je)}=1: Rather than injecting each span embedding directly, the model computes a relevance-weighted mixture over their representations:
S =
Qij Sij) (i,j)es'
where Sij e Rd is the encoded representation for span (i,j), and Qij € [0, 1] is its normalized attention weight."
44,"To compute the interpolation weights Qij) each span is assigned a scalar relevance logit: fscore(sij, Oij = type Qij 9 Pij confij) , which may be a learned function over span length Sij' type entropy; boundary confidence, or addi- tional pooled features A softmax transformation ensures normalization: exp(Wij , Qij 3 (a,b)esi exp(wab > so that

The final interpolated vector $ (Equation 1) functions as a global span summary: It may be inserted as a controller token [5], prepended as a prefix vector [30], or concatenated to the sequence input for downstream fusion [38]. Because all operations are differentiable; the interpolation mechanism supports full gradient flow and can be trained jointly with other modules."

3.8 Runtime Complexity
key design goal of X-Spanformer is to enhance structural awareness without compromising com- putational efficiency To this end, we decompose the end-to-end forward pass into three core stages:
Span enumeration and scoring: generation and scoring of candidate spans from the input sequence; Embedding and selection of top-ranked spans: pooling span-level representations and selecting & subset for contextual conditioning; Joint contextualization: applying a standard transformer encoder over the combined se - quence of tokens and selected spans:
This modular design ensures that added computational cost remains subquadratic for the first two stages, while the dominant quadratic term scales with total input length:  Similar hybrid strategies are used in sparse attention transformers [41, 42] and routing-based models [43, 44]. The proposition below formalizes the overall runtime cost: Proposition 4 (Runtime Bound) . Let L be the input sequence length; K the number of retained spans, Umax the maximum span width, and d the model's hidden dimension: Then the total forward pass runtime of X-Spanformer is:
O(Lrmax , +O(Kd) + O(L + K)2). Proof: The total runtime decomposes into the following: (1) Span enumeration and scoring: Each of the L tokens anchors up to Umax rightward spans."
48,"Each span is scored by a parameterized function fe(wi:j), typically an MLP o bilinear form. Hence the cost is: 0(Lwmax ,
(2) Span encoding and filtering: After top-K selection, each span is pooled (e:8 , via mean or self-attention) into a vector of dimension d, and scored by span-type and confidence heads: These operations are linear in d, giving: O(Kd). 11"
49,"X-SPANFORMER

(3) Joint contextualization: The final sequence consists of original L tokens and K span em - beddings, resulting in (L+ K) total elements. Processing this sequence using standard transformer self-attention [4] yields: O((L + K)?d): Since d is fixed during training, we absorb it into the constant, yielding:
O((L + K)2)."

Layerwise Entropy Effects
To trace structure emergence, we compare span selections under low (~ = 0.01) vs. high (y = 0.10) entropy schedules: Prior work has shown that annealed entropy regularization sharpens composi- tional attention [53, 28]; in our setting, lower 7 values maintain broader exploratory overlap; while

sharper schedules induce minimal yet targeted spans: This suggests routing entropy governs the model's syntactic compression bias:
Interpretability Metric (Span Jaccard Index)
To quantify alignment with reference spans R = {r;}, we compute the max-overlap Jaccard index for each induced span Si: K and J = J(si_ K i=1"
151,"= max TjeR Isi Ur;l This interpretable overlap score is inspired by constituency evaluation metrics used in unsupervised syntax induction [55, 63]. We find that average J improves with training and correlates with increased controller confidence (lower entropy) , especially in layers 4-6. Conclusion
Induced spans tend to reflect coherent linguistic structure without explicit syntactic supervision."
152,"The consistency with constituent and semantic boundaries suggests that controller-guided routing induces soft parsing-like behavior; validating the design principle of compositional priors via differ- entiable selectors [30, 51].

Entropy Decay Rate Y € {0.01, 0.1, 0.5}: Controls the rate in the entropy regularization schedule Aent (t) = Aoe-vt , (36) which governs routing sparsity and confidence evolution throughout training [75, 53]."

Proof: Follows directly from exponential decay bounds 0n entropy-regularized softmax distributions [75]. See Proposition 8 for detailed derivation
This result provides theoretical support for the routing sparsification observed in Section 5.4, con- firming that entropy scheduling is sufficient to yield selective, interpretable span patterns; provided Ao and ~ are chosen to balance exploration and convergence. 5.6 Future Benchmarks and Tasks
We outline evaluation pathways beyond the current architecture sketch; emphasizing both transfer- ability and interpretability:
Downstream: Apply X-Spanformer to named entity recognition (NER), abstractive summa- rization, latent syntax induction, and low-resource translation: Prior   work has  shown that span-based representations improve entity boundary detection [78], and that structured routing enhances summarization in data-scarce regimes [79, 80]."
164,"Latent syntax models have also ben- efited from unsupervised span induction [55], suggesting that X-Spanformer's controller-guided spans may offer a viable inductive bias: Structural transfer: Warm-start span modules on synthetic corpora with known routing tem- plates, then freeze Or partially fine-tune only the task-specific decoder. This aligns with recent work on warm-starting and transfer learning for efficient adaptation [81, 80], and may reduce overfitting in low-resource domains: Controller probing: Freeze routing weights and inject either random Or interpretable controller vectors $ into downstream encoders: This enables causal probing of span semantics and disen- tanglement, similar to frozen transformer interventions in multimodal Or multilingual settings [82, 81]."
165,"These directions aim to validate the modularity and generalization capacity of X-Spanformer across both structured and unstructured tasks. We plan to release diagnostic notebooks and controller visualization tools to support reproducibility and community benchmarking:
Visualization Framework and Interpretability Interfaces
Interpretability is central to the X-Spanformer framework, not only for debugging but for validating the emergence of structured behavior from differentiable routing: We introduce a modular  visu- alization suite designed to capture dynamic routing patterns, evaluate alignment with linguistic structure; and probe causal effects of controller activations These interfaces build 0n the interpretability literature in structured attention [83, 84], entropy- based pruning [75, 53], and latent syntactic probing [85, 55]. Together, they scaffold an interactive environment for qualitative and quantitative analysis of controller behavior throughout training:
