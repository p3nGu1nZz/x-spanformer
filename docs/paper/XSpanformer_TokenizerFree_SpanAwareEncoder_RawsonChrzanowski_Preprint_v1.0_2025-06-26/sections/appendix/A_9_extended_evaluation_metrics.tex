\subsection{Extended Evaluation Metrics}
\label{sec:extended-metrics}

In addition to the main metrics, we measured:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
	\item Memory footprint: peak GPU RAM during inference.
	\item Throughput: tokens/sec on batch size 32 across corpora.
	\item Segmentation consistency: IOU overlap\footnote{Intersection over Union (IoU) computed as $|\text{spans}_1 \cap \text{spans}_2| / |\text{spans}_1 \cup \text{spans}_2|$ to measure span boundary agreement across random seeds.} of spans across runs with different seeds.
	\item Compression entropy: average per-token entropy before and after pruning\footnote{Entropy measured as $H = -\sum_i p_i \log p_i$ over span probability distributions, quantifying information compression achieved by span selection.}.
\end{itemize}
