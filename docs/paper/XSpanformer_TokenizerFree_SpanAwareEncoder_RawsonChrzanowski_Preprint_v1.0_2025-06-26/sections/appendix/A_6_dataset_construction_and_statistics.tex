\subsection{Dataset Construction and Statistics}
\label{sec:dataset}

We constructed three corpora:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
	\item \textbf{Code subset:} 10M lines of Python and JavaScript, avg.\ length 120 codepoints.
	\item \textbf{Multilingual subset:} 5M sentences across 10 languages, avg.\ 80 codepoints.
	\item \textbf{Hybrid subset:} 2M docs mixing code and prose, avg.\ 200 codepoints.
\end{itemize}
All datasets were cleaned for control characters and split 80/10/10 for train/val/test.
