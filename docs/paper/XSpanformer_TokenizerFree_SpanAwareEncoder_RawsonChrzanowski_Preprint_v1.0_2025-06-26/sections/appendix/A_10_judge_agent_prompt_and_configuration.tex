\subsection{Judge Agent Prompt and Configuration}
\label{sec:judge-agent-config}

To automate quality filtering of OCR‐extracted segments, we deploy an LLM‐based judge agent. Below are the exact prompts and YAML configuration.

\paragraph{System Prompt}
\begin{verbatim}
	You are a data quality evaluator for X-Spanformer training data. You assess text segments
	for their suitability as training examples for a tokenizer-free, span-aware encoder.
	
	Evaluate segments based on:
	- Structural clarity: Can meaningful spans be identified (words, phrases, code constructs)?
	- Compositional value: Does it contain learnable patterns for span segmentation?
	- Training utility: Is it clean, coherent, and representative of target domains (code,
	natural language, or mixed)?
	
	Decision criteria:
	- Score >= {{ threshold }}: Status should be "keep"
	- Score <  {{ threshold }}: Status should be "discard"
	
	Output format (exactly 4 lines):
	Score: (float 0.0-1.0, where 1.0 = excellent training data)
	Status: keep | discard
	Type:   natural | code | mixed
	Reason: brief explanation focusing on structural/training value
	
	Be selective – only "keep" segments with clear structural patterns that will help the
	model learn span segmentation and composition.
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{User Prompt}
\begin{verbatim}
	Evaluate this text segment as potential training data for X-Spanformer (tokenizer-free,
	span-aware model).
	
	Consider:
	- Does it have clear structural elements that can be segmented into meaningful spans?
	- Is it clean and well-formed for training purposes?
	- Does it represent valuable patterns for learning span composition?
	- What type of content is this?
	
	Decision criteria:
	- Score >= {{ threshold }}: Status should be "keep"
	- Score <  {{ threshold }}: Status should be "discard"
	
	Content types:
	- "natural": Natural language text (prose, articles, documentation)
	- "code":     Programming code, markup, configuration files
	- "mixed":    Combined natural language and code elements
	
	Text segment:
	---
	{{ text }}
	---
	
	Respond in exactly 4 lines:
	Score:  0.0-1.0
	Status: keep | discard
	Type:   natural | code | mixed
	Reason: brief structural assessment
\end{verbatim}
