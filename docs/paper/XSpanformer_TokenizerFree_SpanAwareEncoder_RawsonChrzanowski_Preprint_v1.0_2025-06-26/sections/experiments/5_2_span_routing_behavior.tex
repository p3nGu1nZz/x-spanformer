\subsection{Span Routing Behavior}
\label{sec:span-behavior}

We analyze the internal span distribution dynamics induced by the X-Spanformer's entropy-regularized selection module. The goal is to assess whether the model exhibits structure-seeking behavior through interpretable routing patterns under curriculum-controlled exploration.

\vspace{0.5em}
\noindent Let \(P = \{P_{ij}\}\) denote the normalized span distribution from Equation~\eqref{eq:span_softmax}, and let the controller be computed as:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{s} = \sum_{k=1}^K \alpha_k s_k, \quad \text{where} \quad \alpha_k = \frac{\exp(w_k)}{\sum_{\ell=1}^K \exp(w_\ell)}.
\label{eq:span_behavior_controller}
\end{equation}

To understand convergence properties and architectural expressivity, we track the following quantitative signals:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
  \item \textbf{Span Entropy Dynamics:}
  The Shannon entropy of \(P_t\) is computed at each training epoch \(t\):
  \begin{equation}
  H(P_t) = -\sum_{(i,j)} P_{ij}^{(t)} \log P_{ij}^{(t)}.
  \end{equation}
  We hypothesize that the expectation \(\mathbb{E}[H(P_t)]\) follows exponential decay due to the schedule
  \[
  \lambda_{\mathrm{ent}}(t) = \lambda_0 \cdot \exp(-\gamma t),
  \]
  as derived in Section~\ref{sec:span-induction}, mirroring curriculum learning effects observed in \cite{bengio2009curriculum, kreutzer2021distilling}.

  \item \textbf{Span Width Histogram:}
  Let \(w = j - i\). For each epoch, we compute the empirical distribution of selected span widths among top-K spans. A shift toward medium-length (5–12 token) units may indicate phrase- or clause-level abstraction consistent with constituent boundaries \cite{naradowsky2021structured}.

  \item \textbf{Span Overlap Rate:}
  We define token-level overlap for each instance by computing the pairwise intersection among selected spans:
  \[
  \mathrm{Overlap}(x) = \frac{1}{K^2} \sum_{k \neq \ell} \frac{|s_k \cap s_\ell|}{|s_k \cup s_\ell|}.
  \]
  High values in early epochs reflect exploratory collapse, while convergence to disjoint or minimally overlapping spans signals stabilization of routing priors.

  \item \textbf{Routing Stability Across Epochs:}
  To quantify change in span selection over time, we measure the symmetric KL divergence between distributions at adjacent epochs:
  \[
  \mathrm{KL}_\mathrm{sym}(P_t \,\|\, P_{t+1}) = \mathrm{KL}(P_t \,\|\, P_{t+1}) + \mathrm{KL}(P_{t+1} \,\|\, P_t).
  \]
  Declining divergence indicates the system has stabilized its structural hypothesis.
\end{itemize}

\noindent These routing diagnostics provide evidence that X-Spanformer gradually shifts from high-entropy, overlapping routing to sparse, high-confidence span representations. This aligns with latent attention sparsification in architectures such as MoE Transformers \cite{shazeer2017outrageously}, Routing Transformers \cite{tay2020sparse}, and mixture-of-expert decoders \cite{gupta2022molt}. Crucially, our formulation achieves this behavior without discrete gating or reinforcement-based span extraction, relying entirely on differentiable gradient flow from the full objective:
\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{final}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda_{\mathrm{ent}}(t) \cdot H(P_t) + \beta_1 \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{align}},
\]
where \(\lambda_{\mathrm{ent}}(t) = \lambda_0 e^{-\gamma t}\) controls the entropy decay schedule and \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{align}}\) optionally enforces span-level alignment during supervised routing.
