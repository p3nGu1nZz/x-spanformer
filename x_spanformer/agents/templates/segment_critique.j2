Consider:
- Does it have clear structural elements that can be segmented into meaningful spans?
- Is it clean and well-formed for training purposes?
- Does it represent valuable patterns for learning span composition?

Decision criteria:
- Score â‰¥ {{ threshold }}: Status should be "keep" 
- Score < {{ threshold }}: Status should be "revise" if improvable, "discard" if not
